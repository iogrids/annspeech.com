            I am a 23 year old who has been stuttering since 4 years of age. My stuttering worsened after a brief period of illness and hospitalization. It was affecting my work life as my job involved meeting new clients and talking to them. I decided to start speech therapy and have seen great improvement since day one. I am able to converse well with my clients now and my confidence has improved a lot.

              I had been struggling with stuttering since my childhood. I had
              low confidence and self esteem due to which I had poor social
              life. I wanted a cure from this difficulty and thatâ€™s when I
              sought help from Ms.Ann, a very dedicated and passionate speech
              therapist. She introduced techniques and strategies that helped me
              to overcome stuttering. I am able to maintain my fluent speech and
              speak well with others these days.

            My son is 13 years of age. He has had academic and language issues along with stammering since his school years. Speech therapy has helped a lot in progressing in his skills and achieving fluent speech. The therapy for stuttering was very systematic and my son learned to self evaluate and manage stuttering really well.

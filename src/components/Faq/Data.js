    question: 'Does online speech therapy work for children?',
    answer:
      'Researches show that online speech therapy (aka telepractice) can provide the same results as offline sessions. Telepractice is an effective, evidenced based program that works well for both kids and adults. Online sessions are highly interactive and children usually look forward to attending these sessions. Parents also play a major role by actively involving in the sessions and learning to generalise activities at home. In some cases where children are too young to sit or if the presenting conditions are severe, sessions would focus on training the parents to effectively carry out the activities at home.',

  {
    question: 'How well online therapy works for adults?',
    answer:
      'Online speech therapy works well for adults with stuttering/stammering, pronunciation difficulties, voice issues, communication difficulties due to stroke, parkinsons disease, dementia etc. Great success has been seen for adolescents and adults who choose online speech therapy services. Additionally, online speech therapy saves time and cost of travel. You can also attend sessions from the convenience of your home.',
